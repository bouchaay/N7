The project required a deep understanding of network protocols, data structures, and object-oriented programming in Ada. Despite challenges with implementing the cache eviction policy and debugging routing algorithms, I overcame them through careful planning and testing.

One way we do this is through teamwork projects, where students work together to develop ideas and solutions for improving sustainable development at our school. Our current project focuses on raising awareness of sustainable development by considering different cases and needs, as well as developing innovative solutions to improve sustainable development at N7. In the 20th of april 2023, we organized a day to raise awareness about disabilities. We had a lot of activities such as a sport activities, a theatrical play, and we listened to a student speechs about some projects that can be done to help people with disabilities. Me and my team proposed a project which is an application called 'The Sign' that uses the AI to help people with disabilities to communicate with others. It can translate a miming video to a script and vice versa. Our team is composed of :</p>

This engaging and informative workshop facilitates a clear understanding of global warming and the various climate-related challenges we face today, similar to how the IPCC would present the information but with a more playful approach. Participants learn about the functioning of natural processes such as greenhouse gases (GHGs), the impact of human activities on the environment and ecosystems, the consequences of climate change on the socio-political and environmental balance of the world, and the solutions that can be implemented at both an individual and collective level. In addition to being an educational tool, La Fresque du Climat is also an association committed to raising awareness about environmental issues. It achieves this by organizing more and more Climate Frescoes and regularly training volunteer animators to lead them. The association now has over 6,000 volunteers, and its mission remains the same: to help people understand climate change and offer solutions for action.</p>
